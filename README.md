Face detection with C# and EmguCV

Hello everyone, The easiest way to detect face is to use Haar Cascades. We will do face detection using haar cascades classifier in C#. You can get images on C# with EmguCV.



## Run it on your computer

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/4thAhmet/Face_Recognition
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Face_Recognition
```

Gerekli paketleri y√ºkleyin

```bash
    Install the Visual Studio 2022
    Install the Aforge.Direct.Show package for camera use.
    Install version 4.11.3497 of Emgu.CV package to manipulate the image
```

Run the solution.

```bash
  Run FaceDetection.sln
```
Build the project and get started

```bash
  press F5
```



## What did I learn?

This project was done in the learning phase. With this project, I learned the Haar Cascade classifier and performed face recognition.
I learned to use the Emgucv library and to perform operations on the image. I realized this project with C#.
